# MyMLToolbox
trying to make a custom ML library that I can reuse for all projects

## installation
- install Anaconda 3 from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
- run `conda create --name toolbox --file conda_env.txt` to install the conda environment
- activate conda environment by running `conda activate toolbox`
- install other pip packages (just to be sure?) with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
